We thank the referee for the extremely fast turn-around time in the
review of our revised manuscript. We address the remaining points of
concern below and have changed the text accordingly.  As before, we
have marked our changes using AASTeX revision markup features.

Responses to individual points are listed below.

We want to point out that we did not "hide" the observations dates. They are clearly listed in Table 1, which promiently spans about half a
page. Our text also provides ample citation to Harigan & Kenyon
(2003), who analysed the data before us, so it clearly must have been
taken before 2003.

Nevertheless, we see no harm in pointing out the dates in more places
- in our opinion the fact that we can still learn something new from
"old" data is a testament to the value of a well-kept archive!

We agree that a significant fraction of our citations are references
to seminal papers such as Bandfort & Payne (1982). We have expanded
the introduction again to cover more of the theoretical work in the
last 5-6 years.

Our wording was "limited to lower dimensions and/or ideal MHD". Both
references are examples for simulations with < 3D (2.5 D in this
case). We have switched the order to "ideal MHD and/or less than three
full dimensions" to avoid a misunderstanding here. Casse & Keppens
use a resistive accretion disk and ideal MHD in the jet.

> Therefore, also the summary needs to be improved.

We have added a few more details to the summary. We regard the
following facts of main results of this study:

- Jets are resolved for those two stars with complex [O I] line profiles at the stellar position.
- In DF Tau, the HVC is accelarated within 15 au.
- In DF Tau, HVC and MVC seem to be part of the collimated outflow.
- The outflow patter in UY Aur is stable over at least a decade.

We have tried to clarify further in the text and in table 3.
